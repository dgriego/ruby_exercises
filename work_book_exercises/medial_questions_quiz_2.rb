# 1)
# Figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.

# 2)
# Augment the following hash such that it has additional
# key value pairs that can act as a "sort index" which will
# allow us to quickly re-arrange a list of our family members
# as either sorted by name-length or sorted by their original
# order as shown here:

# 3)
# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties
# is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded
# string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name,
# age and gender of each family member:
